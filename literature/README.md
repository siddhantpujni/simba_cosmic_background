# Literature

This directory contains literature review materials, papers, and reading notes related to the cosmic background research project.

## Structure

- **`papers/`**: Store PDF files of relevant papers, organized by topic or author
- **`notes/`**: Your reading notes, summaries, and literature review documents

## Organization Guidelines

### Papers Directory

Organize papers by topic or use a flat structure with descriptive filenames:

```
papers/
├── cosmic_background/
├── simba_simulation/
├── powderday_radiative_transfer/
└── observational_studies/
```

Or use descriptive filenames:
```
papers/
├── Dave2019_Simba_MNRAS.pdf
├── Narayanan2021_Powderday_ApJS.pdf
└── Dole2006_CIB_A&A.pdf
```

### Notes Directory

Keep structured notes for each paper or topic:

```
notes/
├── 2024-01-15_dave2019_simba_notes.md
├── literature_review_draft.md
└── cosmic_background_summary.md
```

## Recommendations

- Use Markdown for notes to keep them version-controllable
- Include bibliographic information in notes (author, year, journal, DOI)
- Add tags or keywords at the top of each note file
- Consider using reference management software (Zotero, Mendeley, etc.) alongside these files
- Keep a `bibliography.bib` file for LaTeX references

## Reference Management

Consider maintaining a BibTeX file here:
```
literature/bibliography.bib
```

This can be used directly in LaTeX documents for the paper.
