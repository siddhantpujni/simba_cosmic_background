    "Goal now is to work towards combining output from last two weeks into making a prediction for the observed cosmic SED. Essentially means accouting for fact that higher $z$ galaxies will be dimmer. Aiming to do this through a lightcone using Chris Lovell's lightcone generation code for SIMBA. Then finally sum the apparent magnitudes as is already being done to get total SED."
