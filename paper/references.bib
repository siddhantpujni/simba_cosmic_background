  abstract = {The cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED) is the total emissivity as a function of wavelength of galaxies in a given cosmic volume. We compare the observed CSED from the UV to the submm to that computed from the EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, post-processed with stellar population synthesis models and including dust radiative transfer using the SKIRT code. The agreement with the data is better than 0.15 dex over the entire wavelength range at redshift z = 0, except at UV wavelengths where the EAGLE model overestimates the observed CSED by up to a factor of 2. Global properties of the CSED as inferred from CIGALE fits, such as the stellar mass density, mean star formation density, and mean dust-to-stellar-mass ratio, agree to within better than 20 per cent. At higher redshift, EAGLE increasingly underestimates the CSED at optical--NIR wavelengths with the FIR/submm emissivity underestimated by more than a factor of 5 by redshift z = 1. We believe that these differences are due to a combination of incompleteness of the EAGLE-SKIRT data base, the small simulation volume and the consequent lack of luminous galaxies, and our lack of knowledge on the evolution of the characteristics of the interstellar dust in galaxies. The impressive agreement between the simulated and observed CSED at lower z confirms that the combination of EAGLE and SKIRT dust processing yields a fairly realistic representation of the local Universe.},

  abstract = {We study the star formation quenching mechanism in cluster galaxies by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Herschel Reference Survey, a complete volume-limited K-band-selected sample of nearby galaxies including objects in different density regions, from the core of the Virgo cluster to the general field. The SEDs of the target galaxies were fitted using the CIGALE SED modelling code. The truncated activity of cluster galaxies was parametrised using a specific star formation history with two free parameters, the quenching age QA and the quenching factor QF. These two parameters are crucial for the identification of the quenching mechanism, which acts on long timescales when starvation processes are at work, but is rapid and efficient when ram pressure occurs. To be sensitive to an abrupt and recent variation of the star formation activity, we combined twenty photometric bands in the UV to far-infrared in a new way with three age-sensitive Balmer line absorption indices extracted from available medium-resolution (R {$\sim$} 1000) integrated spectroscopy and with H{$\alpha$} narrow-band imaging data. The use of a truncated star formation history significantly increases the quality of the fit in HI-deficient galaxies of the sample, that is to say, in those objects whose atomic gas content has been removed during the interaction with the hostile cluster environment. The typical quenching age of the perturbed late-type galaxies is QA {$<\sim$} 300 Myr whenever the activity of star formation is reduced by 50\% {$<$} QF {$\leq$} 80\% and QA {$<\sim$} 500 Myr for QF {$>$} 80\%, while that of the quiescent early-type objects is QA ' 1-3 Gyr. The fraction of late-type galaxies with a star formation activity reduced by QF {$>$} 80\% and with an HI-deficiency parameter HI - de f {$>$} 0.4 drops by a factor of {$\sim$}5 from the inner half virial radius of the Virgo cluster (R/Rvir {$<$} 0.5), where the hot diffuse X-ray emitting gas of the cluster is located, to the outer regions (R/Rvir {$>$} 4). The efficient quenching of the star formation activity observed in Virgo suggests that the dominant stripping process is ram pressure. We discuss the implication of this result in the cosmological context of galaxy evolution.},

Simba includes updates to Mufasa's sub-resolution star formation and feedback prescriptions, and introduces black hole growth via the torque-limited accretion model of Angl\'es-Alc\'azar et al. (2017) from cold gas and Bondi accretion from hot gas, along with black hole feedback via kinetic bipolar outflows and X-ray energy. Ejection velocities are taken to be \textasciitilde 10\textasciicircum 3 km/s at high Eddington ratios, increasing to \textasciitilde 8000 km/s at Eddington ratios below 2\%, with a constant momentum input of 20L/c. Simba further includes an on-the-fly dust production, growth, and destruction model. Our Simba run with (100 Mpc/h)\textasciicircum 3 and 1024\textasciicircum 3 gas elements reproduces numerous observables, including galaxy stellar mass functions at z=0-6, the stellar mass--star formation rate main sequence, HI and H2 fractions, the mass-metallicity relation at z=0 and z=2, star-forming galaxy sizes, hot gas fractions in massive halos, and z=0 galaxy dust properties. However, Simba also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z=0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies. We show that Simba's jet feedback is primarily responsible for quenching massive galaxies.},

Broadly, we find good agreement in both the spectrum and the derived star formation histories. If we use a power-law star formation history model in which the star formation rate is \textasciitilde (1+z){$\beta$} out to z=1, then we find that a {$\beta$} of 2-3 is still the most likely model and that there is no evidence for current surveys to be missing large amounts of star formation at high redshift. In particular, ``fossil cosmology'' of the local universe gives measures of star formation history that are consistent with direct observations at high redshift. Using the photometry of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we are able to derive the cosmic spectrum in absolute units (i.e., units of W \AA -1 Mpc-3) at 2-5 \AA{} resolution and find good agreement with published broadband luminosity densities. For a Salpeter initial mass function, the best-fit stellar mass-to-light ratio is 3.7-7.5 Msolar/Lsolar in the r band (corresponding to \textohm starsh=0.0025-0.0055), and from both the stellar emission history and the H{$\alpha$} luminosity density independently we find a cosmological star formation rate of 0.03-0.04 h Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 today.},

  abstract = {Cosmic background (CB) radiation, encompassing the sum of emission from all sources outside our own Milky Way galaxy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, is a fundamental phenomenon in observational cosmology. Many experiments have been conceived to measure it (or its constituents) since the extragalactic Universe was first discovered; in addition to estimating the bulk (cosmic monopole) spectrum, directional variations have also been detected over a wide range of wavelengths. Here we gather the most recent of these measurements and discuss the current status of our understanding of the CB from radio to {$\gamma$}-ray energies. Using available data in the literature, we piece together the sky-averaged intensity spectrum and discuss the emission processes responsible for what is observed. We examine the effect of perturbations to the continuum spectrum from atomic and molecular line processes and comment on the detectability of these signals. We also discuss how one could, in principle, obtain a complete census of the CB by measuring the full spectrum of each spherical harmonic expansion coefficient. This set of spectra of multipole moments effectively encodes the entire statistical history of nuclear, atomic, and molecular processes in the Universe.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             We use the simba cosmological galaxy formation simulation to investigate the relationship between major mergers (\$\textbackslash lesssim\$4:1), starbursts, and galaxy quenching. Mergers are identified via sudden jumps in stellar mass M* well above that expected from in~situ star formation, while quenching is defined as going from specific star formation rate (sSFR) \$\textbackslash gt t\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm H\textbraceright\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -1\textbraceright\$ to \$\textbackslash lt 0.2t\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash rm H\textbraceright\textasciicircum\textbraceleft -1\textbraceright\$, where tH is the Hubble time. At z {$\approx$} 0--3, mergers show {$\sim$}2--3\texttimes{} higher SFR than a mass-matched sample of star-forming galaxies, but globally represent \$\textbackslash lesssim 1\textbraceleft\textbraceleft\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\textbraceright\textbraceright\$ of the cosmic SF budget. At low masses, the increase in SFR in mergers is mostly attributed to an increase in the H2 content, but for \$M\_*\textbackslash gtrsim 10\textasciicircum\textbraceleft 10.5\textbraceright{} \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\textbraceleft{} M\textbraceright\_\textbraceleft\textbackslash odot \textbraceright\$ mergers also show an elevated star formation efficiency suggesting denser gas within merging galaxies. The merger rate for star-forming galaxies shows a rapid increase with redshift,~{$\propto$}(1 + z)3.5, but the quenching rate evolves much more slowly,~{$\propto$}(1 + z)0.9; there are insufficient mergers to explain the quenching rate at \$z\textbackslash lesssim 1.5\$. simba first quenches galaxies at \$z\textbackslash gtrsim 3\$, with a number density in good agreement with observations. The quenching time-scales {$\tau$}q are strongly bimodal, with `slow' quenchings ({$\tau$}q {$\sim$} 0.1tH) dominating overall, but `fast' quenchings ({$\tau$}q {$\sim$} 0.01tH) dominating in M* {$\sim$} 1010--1010.5\,M\$\textbackslash odot\$ galaxies, likely induced by simba's jet-mode black hole feedback. The delay time distribution between mergers and quenching events suggests no physical connection to either fast or slow quenching. Hence, simba predicts that major mergers induce starbursts, but are unrelated to quenching in either fast or slow mode.},

These simulations follow the non-linear evolution of galaxies modeling a variety of physical processes over an enormous range of scales. A better understanding of the physics relevant for shaping galaxies, improved numerical methods, and increased computing power have led to simulations that can reproduce a large number of observed galaxy properties. Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component. Cosmological simulations have also proven useful to study alternative cosmological models and their impact on the galaxy population. This review presents a concise overview of the methodology of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and their different applications.},

  abstract = {Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR {$\approx$} 10-11 yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M and increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond {$\sim$}2 Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within {$\sim$}Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers.},
